# Lifeband-API
This is a NodeJS api for lifeband project that provides information about devices, along with fetched and analysed data. It also has endpoints to get other information, such as logs etc.

The lifeband API is the central piece of communication for devices and all the client applications. It provides methods for device authentication, event logging, user account management and other services to communicate directly with the system.

The lifeband API is also easy to use. It is also lightweight, modular and asynchronous which makes it very quick and minimises memory usage.
